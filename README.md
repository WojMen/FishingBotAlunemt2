# FishingBotAlunemt2

This script is gonna work for every metin server, where fishing includes pressing certain amount of spaces based on showed image

# Is it safe?

Program isn't injecting anything into your metin-launcher, its all working as if user was clicking so yes its 100% safe.

# How does it work?

By using library pyautogui you can scan for certain images on the screen or certain part of it. If the image you are looking for is closely the same, program is going to run proper function.

# Can i contribute?

Of course I'd be happy to improve this program.
